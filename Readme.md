This repository contains my solutions to some exercises taken from the excellent book
"Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce A. Tate. The book covers some really cool languages:

* Ruby
* Io
* Prolog
* Scala
* Erlang
* Clojure
* Haskell

I tried to give some meaningful names to the source code files, apart from that, the code should
speak for itself, especially as the examples are not that long.
